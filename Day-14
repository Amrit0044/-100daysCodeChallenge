Write a program to print the sum of the first n odd numbers.


#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n, i, sum = 0;
    printf("Enter the value of n: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    for (i = 1; i <= 2 * n; i += 2) {
        sum += i;
    }

    printf("Sum of the first %d odd numbers is %d\n", n, sum);

    return 0;
}



Write a program to print the product of even numbers from 1 to n


#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n, i;
    unsigned long long product = 1;

    printf("Enter the value of n: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    // If no even numbers in range, product is handled as 1 (neutral element for multiplication)
    int hasEven = 0;

    for (i = 2; i <= n; i += 2) {
        product *= i;
        hasEven = 1;
    }

    if (hasEven)
        printf("Product of even numbers from 1 to %d is %llu\n", n, product);
    else
        printf("There are no even numbers in the given range.\n");

    return 0;
}
